            <h2>I AM IRON MAN</h2>
            <p>Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this
            back... it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a normal version of
            the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>God, what a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone, let alone you know to this extent...
            I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness and light that have come
            into play. And for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's going to find a way to grow up in. So I found a private
            area to record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that death at any time is ever timely.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This time travel thing that we are going to pull off tomorrow... it's got me scratching my head about the survivability
            of all this. But then again that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What am I tripping for? Everything is
            going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love you 3000.</p>
